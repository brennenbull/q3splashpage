            <h3>Why Water?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Your body depends on water to survive. Every cell, organ and tissue requires water to function properly. The body uses water to lubricate joints, maintain its temperature and remove waste. Staying hydrated helps the heart pump blood easier through your blood vessels and to the muscles throughout your body.</p>
